Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

- First call to Sum2DArray: Logs "Sum Called.." 
- Sum calculation is scheduled
- "Returning from sum" is logged 
- "Rejecting" is logged because its a bad input
- The Sum2DArray is called again with a string array and it logs "Sum called"
- Since the input is not an array the else block is called and logs "rejecting.."
- The sumPromise2 is returned from the second call to Sum2DArray and logs "Bad Input:.."
- Now all the synchronous code was executed. The callback from set Timeout in the first Sum2DArray and executes it and
that calulates the sum and logs "resolving..."
- sumPromise1 is called and the sum of the 2D array is logged.
